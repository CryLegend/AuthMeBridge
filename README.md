# AuthMeBridge

![AuthMeBridge](https://crylegend.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/AuthMeBridge.png "AuthMeBridge")

This plugin acts like a bridge between your bukkit servers and your BungeeCord instance. To explain simple how it works, bukkit-side plugins send a message to bungee-side on user authentication. If bungee-side doesn't receive this message, the player won't be able to talk in chat and to perform commands, including BungeeCord commands.

Session resume: If you have AuthMe on multiple servers, you can enable autoLogin option that allow you to switch between your servers without having to perform login command again.

## Requirements
